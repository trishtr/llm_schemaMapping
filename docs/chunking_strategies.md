**COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES FOR HANDLING LARGE SCHEMAS IN LLM PROCESSING**
Large database schemas can indeed exceed LLM token limits, which is critical for schema mapping. I've implemented and demonstrated 6 key strategies to handle this challenge:
ðŸŽ¯ KEY STRATEGIES OVERVIEW

1. ðŸ“¦ TABLE-BASED CHUNKING
   Split schemas into manageable chunks (e.g., 2-5 tables per chunk)
   Preserve relationships within and across chunks
   Example: 4 tables â†’ 2 chunks of 2 tables each
   Token Reduction: Distributes load across multiple LLM calls
2. ðŸ”§ DETAIL LEVEL COMPRESSION
   MINIMAL (76.7% reduction): Just names, types, nullability
   ESSENTIAL (45.9% reduction): + PKs, FKs, basic patterns
   STANDARD (0% reduction): + indexes, limited samples
   COMPREHENSIVE: Full detail (original format)
3. ðŸŽ¯ RELEVANCE FILTERING
   Business domain filtering: Focus on relevant tables (e.g., healthcare only)
   Size-based filtering: Exclude small/system tables
   Pattern-based filtering: Match specific table/column patterns
   Example: Healthcare tables only â†’ 39.7% token reduction
4. ðŸ“‹ HIERARCHICAL SUMMARY
   High-level overview (83.9% reduction): Table summaries, row counts, domain classification
   Perfect for initial analysis before detailed processing
   Business domain inference: Automatically categorizes tables
5. ðŸ”„ TOKEN-AWARE PROCESSING
   Estimate token usage (1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters)
   Dynamic chunking based on actual token limits
   Adaptive sizing for different LLM models
6. ðŸ”— COMBINED STRATEGIES
   Filter â†’ Compress â†’ Chunk pipeline
   Multi-pass processing: Summary first, then details
   Context-aware adaptation
   ðŸ“Š DEMONSTRATED RESULTS
   From our enterprise_healthcare_db example (4 tables, 13 columns, 1,585 tokens):
   Strategy Token Count Reduction Use Case
   Original 1,585 0% Full detail needed
   Minimal 370 76.7% Structure mapping
   Essential 858 45.9% Relationship mapping
   Hierarchical 255 83.9% Initial analysis
   Healthcare Filter 955 39.7% Domain-specific mapping
   Large Tables 912 42.5% Focus on main entities
   ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR SCHEMA MAPPING
   Phase 1: ðŸ“‹ Initial Analysis
   Apply to chunking_str...
   }
   Phase 2: ðŸŽ¯ Focused Processing
   Apply relevance filtering based on mapping requirements
   Use essential detail level for relationship understanding
   Chunk by business domains if still too large
   Phase 3: ðŸ“¦ Detailed Mapping
   Process filtered chunks with standard detail
   Maintain relationship context across chunks
   Use sequential processing with context carryover
   ðŸ’¡ PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
   For Different LLM Token Limits:
   GPT-3.5 (4K tokens): Minimal + Heavy filtering
   GPT-4 (8K tokens): Essential + Moderate filtering
   GPT-4 Turbo (128K tokens): Standard + Light chunking
   Claude (200K tokens): Comprehensive for most schemas
   For Different Mapping Tasks:
   Structure Mapping: Minimal detail level
   Relationship Mapping: Essential detail level
   Field-Level Mapping: Standard detail level
   Pattern Analysis: Include detected patterns
   Multi-Pass Processing:
   Overview Pass: Hierarchical summary â†’ Understand structure
   Planning Pass: Essential details â†’ Plan mapping strategy
   Execution Pass: Standard details â†’ Perform detailed mapping
   ðŸ”§ ADAPTIVE PROCESSING
   The system can automatically adapt based on:
   Schema size and complexity
   Available token budget
   Mapping task requirements
   LLM model capabilities
   This comprehensive approach ensures that any size database schema can be effectively processed for LLM-based schema mapping, regardless of token limitations!
